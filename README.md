## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Theme Switching:**  
   The toggle switch changes the website theme between light and dark by toggling the `dark-mode` class on the `body` element.

2. **Smooth Transitions:**  
   CSS transitions make the background and text color changes visually appealing.

3. **Local Storage:**  
   The theme preference is saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring the user's choice persists across sessions.
